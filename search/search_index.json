Brand Analytics Monitoring audience behaviour on social media has so many benefits. For instance, it can help you identify what your target audience likes, what their preferences are, and what they might be interested in hearing more about. It can also show you who your competitors are and how well they are doing compared to you. Customer Churn Tracking churn rate is a useful tool that businesses can use to improve their customer retention. A high turnover rate (churn rate) can be detrimental for any business, as it translates into a significant loss of revenue. In order to evaluate the reasons for this turnover, it is necessary to track and monitor the churn rate closely. Employee Retention Employee retention is a challenge for many companies. This is due to the intense market competition and the high demand for talent. A recent study shows that employees who feel like they are part of a community at work are more engaged, more productive, and less likely to leave. Inventory Management Inventory management involves the control of inventory levels and the prevention of overstocking or understocking. Sales Forecast Different forecasting methods have been developed and each has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, an accurate seasonal adjustment will prevent overestimation on base demand that doesn't exist in reality while an extrapolation method will not adjust for seasonality and therefore produce higher forecasts.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"show-case/#showcase","text":"This section showcases analytic examples of various types of analytics and how they are used in the world of marketing, social media, and other areas.","title":"Showcase"},{"location":"show-case/#brand-analytics","text":"Monitoring audience behaviour on social media has so many benefits.

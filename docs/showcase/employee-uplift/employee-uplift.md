# Employee Uplift

Predictive Analytics

Employee retention is a challenge for many companies. This is due to the intense
market competition and the high demand for talent. A recent study shows that
employees who feel like they are part of a community at work are more engaged,
more productive, and less likely to leave.

Conventional predictive model have an average prediction accuracy of 84%;
it only yields a success rate of 50% when those identified received a
retention program.   Some stay and didn't receive intervention, other left
even though they received intervention.

Retention program cost money, so how can the business fine tune the process to
optmise the results of the retention program.  Wijaya et al.[1] propose a uplift
model which only yields an average accuracy of 67% but yields a consistent
success rate of 100% in targeting the right employee with a retention program.

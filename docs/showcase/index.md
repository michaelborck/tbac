Examples of various types of analytics and how they are used in the world
of marketing, social media, and other areas.


## [Learning Analytics](discussion-board/discussion-board.md)

The world is changing. Communication is moving to digital boards, and
communities are coalescing around these boards. They have also become a
common interactive tool in the learning and teaching environment.

Discussion Boards are an interesting place to examine how people interact
with each other online using different strategies that may be best suited
to their personality or position on a topic. With this notebook, you can
easily visualize and understand the interaction and mood of the discussion.


## [Brand Analytics](brand-analytics/brand-analytics.md)

Monitoring audience behaviour on social media has so many benefits. For
instance, it can help you identify what your target audience likes, what
their preferences are, and what they might be interested in hearing more
about. It can also show you who your competitors are and how well they are
doing compared to you.

## [Customer Churn](customer-churn/00_crisp-dm/00_crisp-dm.md)

Tracking churn rate is a useful tool that businesses can use to improve their
customer retention. A high turnover rate (churn rate) can be detrimental for
any business, as it translates into a significant loss of revenue. In order
to evaluate the reasons for this turnover, it is necessary to track and monitor
the churn rate closely. This example demonstrates the lifecycle of the
Cross-industry Standard Process for Data  Mining (CRISP-DM).


## [Visual Decisions Making](visual-decisions/visual-decisions.md)

People who make decisions need to know what information is relevant and what
is not. Plotting your data can help you spot patterns and trends that you
might not otherwise notice, and help you make better decisions.

## [Automatic PCA Analysis](pca-analysis/pca-analysis.md)

PCA is a technique for transforming a set of variables into a set of
uncorrelated variables. PCA can be used for exploratory data analysis,
dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and many other tasks. PCA is a
linear transformation so it can be implemented efficiently and itâ€™s the most
commonly used algorithm for dimensionality reduction.

## [Brand Analytics](brand-analytics/brand-analytics.md)

Monitoring audience behaviour on social media has so many benefits. For
instance, it can help you identify what your target audience likes, what
their preferences are, and what they might be interested in hearing more
about. It can also show you who your competitors are and how well they are
doing compared to you.

## [Customer Churn](customer-churn/00_crisp-dm.md)

Tracking churn rate is a useful tool that businesses can use to improve their
customer retention. A high turnover rate (churn rate) can be detrimental for
any business, as it translates into a significant loss of revenue. In order
to evaluate the reasons for this turnover, it is necessary to track and monitor
the churn rate closely. This example demonstrates the lifecycle of the
Cross-industry Standard Process for Data  Mining (CRISP-DM).

## [Employee Retention](employee-retention.md)

Employee retention is a challenge for many companies. This is due to the
intense market competition and the high demand for talent. A recent study
shows that employees who feel like they are part of a community at work are
more engaged, more productive, and less likely to leave.

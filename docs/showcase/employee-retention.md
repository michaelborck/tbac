# Employee Retention

Predictive Analytics

Employee retention is a challenge for many companies. This is due to the intense
market competition and the high demand for talent. A recent study shows that
employees who feel like they are part of a community at work are more engaged,
more productive, and less likely to leave.

Conventional predictive model yields an average prediction accuracy of 84%;
it only yields a success rate of 50% to target the right employee with a
retention program on the three datasets. By contrast, the uplift model only
yields an average accuracy of 67% but yields a consistent success rate of 100%
in targeting the right employee with a retention program.

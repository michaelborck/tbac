# Business Understanding

Stage One

Tracking churn rate is a useful tool that businesses can use to improve
their customer retention. A high turnover rate (churn rate) can be detrimental
for any business, as it translates into a significant loss of revenue. In order
to evaluate the reasons for this turnover, it is necessary to track and monitor
the churn rate closely.

Preventing churn is the responsibility of every team within the company.
It’s up to the marketing team to properly educate new buyers, the sales team
to not overset expectations, the customer success team to provide high quality
support, and the product team to build a service that continues to delight
customers. Companies can improve their churn rates by sharing churn data
throughout the company. The more insights each team has into how it can
reduce churn, the more customers the whole company keeps. The outputs of
this step are:

* Set objectives – This means describing your primary objective from a
  business perspective. There may also be other related questions that you
  would like to address. For example, your primary goal might be to keep
  current customers by predicting when they are prone to move to a competitor.
  Related business questions might be “Does the channel used affect whether
  customers stay or go?” or “Will lower ATM fees significantly reduce the
  number of high-value customers who leave?”

* Produce project plan – Here you’ll describe the plan for achieving the
  data mining and business goals. The plan should specify the steps to be
  performed during the rest of the project, including the initial selection
  of tools and techniques.

* Business success criteria – Here you’ll lay out the criteria that you’ll
  use to determine whether the project has been successful from the business
  point of view. These should ideally be specific and measurable, for example
  reduction of customer churn to a certain level, however sometimes it might be
  necessary to have more subjective criteria such as “give useful insights into
  the relationships.” If this is the case then it needs to be clear who it is
  that makes the subjective judgment.

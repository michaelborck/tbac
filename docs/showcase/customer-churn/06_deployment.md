# Deployment

Stage 6

A model is not particularly useful unless the customer can access its results.
The complexity of this phase varies widely. This final phase has four tasks:

* Plan deployment: Develop and document a plan for deploying the model.
* Plan monitoring and maintenance: Develop a thorough monitoring and
  maintenance plan to avoid issues during the operational phase (or
  post-project phase) of a model.
* Produce final report: The project team documents a summary of the project
  which might include a final presentation of data mining results.
* Review project: Conduct a project retrospective about what went well, what
  could have been better, and how to improve in the future.

It doesn't actually stop there,  if the model is going to production, be
sure you maintain the model in production. Constant monitoring and occasional
model tuning is often required.

# Customer Churn
CRISP-DM Lifecycle

Tracking churn rate is a useful tool that businesses can use to improve their
customer retention. A high turnover rate (churn rate) can be detrimental for
any business, as it translates into a significant loss of revenue. In order to
evaluate the reasons for this turnover, it is necessary to track and monitor
the churn rate closely. This example demonstrates the complete lifecycle of the
Cross-industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM).

* Broad ‘project lifecycle’ i.e. back end (data collection, method, IS) through to front end (analysis, visuals, insights, and strategy)
* Autonomous Hub
* Develop a Profile online and internally for our expertise and sorts of problems we can help solve
* Source particular software required
  * Talkwalker

## Workspace/Hub/Showcase 408.1011

* Utilize this space for various events / teaching / industry engagement
* Marketing to prospective students / agents / industry partners
* New name: ‘Digital Analytics Hub’
* Intensive teaching – simulations
* Re-configure Space:
* Control the 9 Monitor Stack on wall
* Breakout zones – own monitors, dividers, white boards, brainstorming, desks, charging
* Share BZs screen onto main screen – or just HDMI may suffice?
* Modular furniture for up to 6 groups
* Hinged monitor so can lay flat for better collab / remove power dynamics
* Improve lighting
* Currently looks good in room, but terrible on recording / distributed or vice versa
* Ability to let people in freely during class – not everyone locked out
